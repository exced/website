### Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)

I recently heard about a technique to generate data using 2 neural networks: it is called GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) and looks like a game between 2 people: a **generator** and a **discriminator**.

The **discriminator** is an image classifier and the **generator** is trying to fool the discriminator by sending a fake image. (i.e. a self generated image).

You can then minimize the difference between the fake image and the real image using gradient descent and eventually you will generate an image that looks like a real one.

### Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN)

This is just an adaptation using a deep classifier.

I used 2 fully-strided convolutional layers with **Relu** activation function and a fully-connected layer with **Sigmoid** activation function.
